# Warehouse-Management-System
WMSPro is a Java-based Warehouse Management System, offering user-friendly tools for efficient inventory control, purchase orders, and customer orders. Leveraging modern technologies, it simplifies warehouse tasks, ensuring accuracy and productivity. Ideal for optimizing warehouse operations.

# Key Features
User Management: WarehouseX offers a role-based access control system with Admin and AppUser roles. Admins have the authority to manage user accounts, activate/deactivate users, and assign the "ACTUATOR" role for advanced access to Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.

Master Data Management: The system allows easy creation and management of master data, including Unit of Measure (UOM), Location, Item, Vendor, Customer, Shipment Type, and more. Data can be imported/exported seamlessly via Excel or RESTful web services.

Inbound Operations: WarehouseX streamlines inbound operations with a structured process that includes Purchase Order (PO), Vendor Invoice (VI), and Goods Receive Note (GRN). These operations must be performed sequentially, ensuring efficient inventory control.

Outbound Operations: For outgoing shipments, WarehouseX enforces an order of operations with Sale Order (SO), Customer Invoice (CI), and Shipment (SHIP). This ensures that customers receive their orders accurately and on time.

Unit of Measurement (UOM): Items are categorized based on UOM, such as piece, box, pallet, or rack, facilitating precise measurement and tracking of inventory.

Shipment Types: Shipment types like air, ship, train, or truck are available for outbound operations. They can be graded based on security, insurance, and delivery speed.

Vendor and Customer Management: WarehouseX supports two user types, Vendors for inbound and Customers for outbound operations. Each user has a unique code, and items are linked to both vendors and customers, ensuring smooth transaction management.

# In a Warehouse Management System (WMS) like the one described in your project, there are typically two main user types:

Vendor:

Role: Vendors are the suppliers or manufacturers who provide goods to the warehouse. They play a crucial role in inbound operations.
Function: Vendors are responsible for delivering items to the warehouse, and their details are used in the purchase order (PO) and goods receive note (GRN) processes.
Access: Vendors may have access to certain parts of the system where they can view and manage their inventory, receive purchase orders, and generate vendor invoices.
Customer:

Role: Customers are the end-users or wholesale buyers who purchase goods from the warehouse. They are central to outbound operations.
Function: Customers place orders, create sales orders (SO), and receive customer invoices (CI) for the items they purchase from the warehouse.
Access: Customers typically have access to the order management and invoicing sections of the system, where they can place orders, view their order history, and manage invoices.
It's important to note that within each of these user types, there can be different roles and permissions based on the specific requirements of the warehouse and the WMS. For example, within the "Vendor" user type, there may be different vendor roles with varying levels of access and responsibilities. Similarly, within the "Customer" user type, different customer roles may exist, such as retail customers and wholesale customers, each with its own set of permissions.

These user types help define and streamline the roles and responsibilities of individuals or entities interacting with the warehouse, ensuring that the right actions are taken at each stage of the warehouse's operation, from receiving goods to fulfilling customer orders.



# tools and technologies
The development of a Warehouse Management System (WMS) project involves various tools and technologies to build, deploy, and maintain the software. Here's a list of common tools and technologies that can be used in such a project:

Programming Language:

Java: Java is a widely used language for building enterprise-level applications, making it a suitable choice for the backend of a WMS.
Development Frameworks:

Spring Boot: Spring Boot simplifies the development of Java applications, providing tools for building robust and scalable applications.
Database Management:

Database System (MySQL): Choose a relational database system to store and manage data related to inventory, orders, users, and more.
Hibernate: Hibernate is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database interaction.
Frontend Development:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Use these web technologies to create the user interface for the application.
Frontend Framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js): Utilize a frontend framework to build interactive and responsive user interfaces.
API Documentation:

Swagger: Swagger is a tool for documenting RESTful APIs, which can be invaluable for users and developers interacting with your system.
Security:

Spring Security: Implement authentication and authorization using Spring Security to secure user access to the application.
OAuth or JWT: Use OAuth or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and token-based authorization.
Database Connectivity:

Spring Data JPA: Spring Data JPA simplifies database access by providing a high-level, object-oriented interface to interact with databases.
Build and Dependency Management:

Maven: Use a build automation tool like Maven to manage project dependencies and build the application.

IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code: Choose an IDE that best suits your development preferences.
Cloud Services (Optional, depending on deployment):


# Conclusion

WarehouseX is a comprehensive Warehouse Management System that empowers businesses to optimize their warehouse operations. It simplifies complex processes, enhances accuracy, and improves productivity, ultimately leading to better customer service and increased operational efficiency.
